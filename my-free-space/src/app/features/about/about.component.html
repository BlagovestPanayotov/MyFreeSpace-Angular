  <p class="intro">The idea of <span>My Free Space.</span> came when I was at my university. I didn't have the resources to go on a normal holiday or even to visit a gym for that matter, so I was jogging in the woods or if I was too tired to run, I just had a walk. In those walks I saw many people (way older than me) walking with a smile and admiring the beauty of nature. </p>
  <p class="intro">One day I was smashed from my work and after a few minutes of walking I was already tired and lay down ,by the walking path I was running. I closed my ease and listened to the sounds around me. At that moment, it just hit me. I was so busy in my everyday job that I didn't realise that I was becoming a man who was far from himself, trying to fit in into the community, to earn a "normal" life. From that moment, I slowed down with my studies and work and started appreciating the little nature around me. It was very surprising that I actually became more productive just by investing a little time in the woods.</p>
